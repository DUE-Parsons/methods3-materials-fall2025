                <p>Now that you have some experience in QGIS, let's expand on that by making a few common types of maps: qualitative and quantitative maps.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Part 1: A Quantitative Thematic Map</h2>
                <p>As you did in <a title="Assignment 2b: A Large Scale Map" href="https://canvas.newschool.edu/courses/1721181/assignments/11401153" data-api-endpoint="https://canvas.newschool.edu/api/v1/courses/1721181/assignments/11401153" data-api-returntype="Assignment">Assignment 2b</a>, focus on a small area within New York (or somewhere else where you can find similar data). Select a point data source such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9">311 requests</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95">car crashes</a></li>
                    <li>...or some other points relevant to your interests/research.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Once you have your data:</p>
                <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                    <li>Filter the data down to a reasonable amount (for example, 311 requests of a particular type over the past month).</li>
                    <li>Count the points in <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/census-download-metadata.page" target="_blank" rel="noopener">census tracts</a> (2020 Census Tracts clipped to shoreline) using <strong>count points in polygons</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Create a <strong>graduated</strong> style of the result, normalized by area.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Consider the colors you're using and the method you're using to classify the data. Consider the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do this classification make sense to you?</li>
                    <li>Are outliers a quirk of the data? Or are they significant?</li>
                    <li>What story is your classification telling? What story would another classification tell?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It might help to refer to a few sources while thinking about this:</p>
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                    <li><a class="instructure_file_link instructure_scribd_file inline_disabled" title="Monmonier-LyingMaps-2005.pdf" href="/courses/1721181/files/125322969?wrap=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lying with Maps</a></li>
                    <li><a class="inline_disabled" href="http://uxblog.idvsolutions.com/2011/10/telling-truth.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Telling the Truth</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog486/node/671">Making Choropleth Maps</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://blog.datawrapper.de/weekly-chart-europegrowth/">Different Units, Different Patterns</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Create a PDF of your map using a print layout. Include map elements as is useful (title, legend, and data source listing are a good start).</p>
                <p>Share your work here including a short summary of your work. Explain what you created and how you did so. What did you have problems with? What did you enjoy? What would you like to know how to do next?</p>            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Part 2: Felt</h2>
                <p>Next week we will start looking at Felt. Please create a login with your New School email address using <a class="external" href="https://felt.com/signup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this link</a>. I'm suggesting that you use a New School address because Felt plans on giving academic licenses sometime soon and it should be easier to join that with a .edu email address.</p>
                <p><strong>Post a screenshot to show that you have successfully signed up and logged in to Felt.</strong></p>
                <p>You don't have to do anything else with Felt for now, we will start talking about it next week.</p>
