            <p>When you <em>join</em> two or more datasets, you combine them feature-by-feature, and this often gives attributes to a feature that it would not have otherwise had.</p>
            <p><strong>Attribute joins</strong> add attributes to features based on a <strong>unique identifier</strong>. Often you will have a spatial dataset (such as a shapefile) and a CSV file with extra data that you would like to map. As long as both the spatial data and the CSV have a common unique identifier (sometimes this is a name, but it could be a unique number or an address) you can join them in QGIS and add the data from the CSV to the spatial data.</p>
            <p>Use attribute joins and US Census data to map either <strong>renter occupancy</strong> or <strong>median household income</strong> (or some other census data if it's more relevant for your research) by census tract in the area within NYC you have been focusing on over the past few assignments.<a class="" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEQDjH8olwM" data-ytt-failcnt="3"></a></p>
            <p>Download census data using <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://data2.nhgis.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IPUMS NHGIS</a>, join with the census tracts, select only the census tracts in NYC, and make a choropleth map with some of the joined data. Choose which data to get:</p>
            <p>For any of the datasets you will want to do the following:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Go to <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://data2.nhgis.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IPUMS NHGIS</a></li>
                <li>For <strong>Geographic Levels</strong> select <strong>CENSUS TRACT</strong></li>
                <li>For <strong>Years</strong> select <strong>2017-2021</strong> under <strong>5-year ranges</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <p>For renter vs owner-occupied under <strong>Topics </strong>select <strong>HOUSING &gt; Tenure and Mortgage Status</strong><strong> </strong>and select the first table (<strong>Tenure</strong>).</p>
            <p>For household income under <strong>Topics</strong> select <strong>INCOME &gt; Household and Family Income</strong><strong> </strong>and select the table called <strong>Median Household Income in the Past 12 Months (in 2021 inflation-adjusted dollars)</strong>.</p>
            <p>For both datasets:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Also select the <strong>Census Tract</strong> file under the <strong>GIS</strong> <strong>FILES</strong> tab.</li>
                <li>Click <strong>Continue</strong> in the Data Cart twice.</li>
                <li>Submit your request and wait for the data to be prepared.</li>
                <li>Download the <strong>Tables</strong> and <strong>GIS Files</strong>.</li>
                <li>Look at the <strong>codebook</strong> in the tables zip file to determine which columns you're interested in.</li>
                <li>Open the census tracts shapefile in QGIS.</li>
                <li>Open the CSV in QGIS. You do not need to open this file in Excel first.</li>
                <li>Join the CSV to the shapefile.</li>
                <li>Make a choropleth based on one or more columns you joined to the shapefile.</li>
                <li>Optionally clip or select by location to focus the map on NYC.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Submitting Your Work</h2>
            <p>Use a QGIS <strong>Print Layout</strong> to create <strong>a PDF or image</strong>. Make sure to add map accessories such as legends, titles, and scale bars as appropriate. Refer to your sources as appropriate.</p>
            <p>Finally, include a <strong>short summary</strong> of what you did for this assignment. Explain what you created and how you did so. What did you have problems with? What did you enjoy? What would you like to know how to do next?</p>
